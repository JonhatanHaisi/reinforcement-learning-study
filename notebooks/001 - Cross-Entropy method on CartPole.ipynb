    "Cross-Entropy is a way to measure how different two probability distributions are. Imagine you have a model that makes predictions, and you want to see how close these predictions are to the actual outcomes. Cross-Entropy gives a number that tells you how good your model is. A lower cross-entropy means your model's predictions are better.\n",
